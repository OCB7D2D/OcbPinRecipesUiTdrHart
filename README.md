# Alternative UI for OCB Pin Recipes Mod - 7 Days to Die (A20) Addon

This needs [OCB Pin Recipes Mod][1] installed in order to work. It will
change the UI for better readability. Based on work done by [tdrhart][2]
as posted in the [original mod thread][2] (thanks). I slightly adjusted
it to fit a bit closer to the original UI.
